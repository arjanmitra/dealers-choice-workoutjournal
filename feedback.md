Excellent job, Arjan! (As always!) All of your react components are set up really nicely! I really like that you're using such complex data models because this is much more closer to what you would see in real life. If you're using so many different data models, there are probably better data types to use than a string for all of the properties. Checkout this guide here: https://codewithhugo.com/sequelize-data-types-a-practical-guide/. The offical sequelize guides also work well for describing the different data types. I've made some additional comments on how you could further improve the data models in the `db.js` file.
Some comments in the `server.js` file about your delete routes.
It might be helpful to refactor this assignment using react-redux. It would clean up your main component because all of the state management logic would be moved out of the component and into the redux reducer and you wouldnt have to pass down all the props. I've commented on the flow of updating and deleting data in the `client/index.js` file. In a nutshell, after you post or delete something, you should handle either adding the new object created to the store or remove the deleted object from the store. since you remove it from the store, it will trigger a re-render, all without needing to send a GET request to receive the updated data.
